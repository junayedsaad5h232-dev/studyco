        <p>He could imagine how a powerful treasure, specifically designed to enhance some aspect of a Deity, could take the power of that Deity to another level. Bob, for example, could cause untold havoc by merely speaking. Now imagine if he had a Divine megaphone!</p>

        <p>A normal treasure, and a treasure which could generate, and use divine energy were not in the same realm. Even others, who were not deities, could make use of treasures that harnessed divine energy.</p>

        <p>He guessed that the appearance of such an ore was not a part of the Artica races plan. Or, if it was, then they were making a grand statement to the universe, and were using this as an opportunity to demonstrate their power and resources.</p>

        <p>Either way, he needed to take advantage of the situation, and his newfound reputation, to get his hands on some of that treasure. He had a feeling that it would be quite difficult to get his hands on this ore pretty soon.</p>

        <p>"You all stay here while I have a word with our hosts," Jack said, his voice audible in the surroundings, keeping up the facade of a powerful and influential figure. "There's been a small change of plans."</p>

        <p>"Captain... Goldilocks ran off while we weren't looking again," Tiny-Sparkles said, feeling a little guilty for not keeping an eye on that troublesome duck.</p>

        <p>"In that case, quickly go and find Goldilocks and bring him back. Make sure he doesn't get into trouble."</p>

        <p>Jack looked around, and noticed that they were still being observed by everyone. Without caring, he released the Jolly Ranchers anchor.</p>

        <p>Write your new chapter here. As you add more text, the notebook paper will automatically get longer and draw new lines for you.</p>
