        <p>He could imagine how a powerful treasure, specifically designed to enhance some aspect of a Deity, could take the power of that Deity to another level. Bob, for example, could cause untold havoc by merely speaking. Now imagine if he had a Divine megaphone!</p>

        <p>A normal treasure, and a treasure which could generate, and use divine energy were not in the same realm. Even others, who were not deities, could make use of treasures that harnessed divine energy.</p>

        <p>"In that case, quickly go and find Goldilocks and bring him back. Make sure he doesn't get into trouble."</p>

        <p>Jack looked around, and noticed that they were still being observed by everyone. Without caring, he released the Jolly Ranchers anchor.</p>
